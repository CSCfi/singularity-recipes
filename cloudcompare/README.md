CloudCompare 2.11.3 installed to Puhti in November 2021 using cloudcompare.def

https://github.com/tyson-swetnam/cloudcompare-docker used as base image, but had issues with Qt, therefore additions were needed.

Also tried container solutions with installation of CloudCompare via snap and flatpak (suggested by http://www.cloudcompare.org/release/) in Ubuntu base image, which both failed.
